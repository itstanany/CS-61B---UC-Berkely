A repository for ccoding projects/assignments/labs of UC Berkerly [CS61B Data structures](https://fa22.datastructur.es/index.html) course -- Fall 2022 class.

### [Project 1](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1/) is 2 parts

####part 1: about implementing `Double Ended Queue` `Deque` data structures using both `LinkedList` and `Array`

####part 2 : Using our implementation of `Deque` in a real world aplication of fenerating a synthesied musical instruments using `Karplus-Strong` algorithm.

### Project 2 is of two parts also :)

#### [Project 2A](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2a/) is about building a web-based Ngram viewer using different data structures like `TreeMap`, `HashMap` and practice reading system files

#### [Project 2B](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2b) is about practicing system design and decision making about which data strucutre to use with minimum
ready to use skeleton code. We built a graph using `Adjecent List`
it is about finding the [Hyponyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy) of a word.
